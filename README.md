`kafka-client`
==============

This package provides a low-level Haskell client for [Apache Kafka][] 0.7.
**Kafka 0.8 and newer are not yet supported.**

Why Kafka 0.7?
:   I needed to interact with a system running Kafka 0.7.

Will 0.8 or newer be supported?
:   There are currently no plans to do so. Unless I end up needing to also
    interact with a Kafka 0.8 system, or receive a pull request, the answer is
    no.
